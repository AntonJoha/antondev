# Who am I???


Hello, my name is **Anton** as I assume you guessed by the domain name. 
I'm from Värmland and currently studying a masters in computer science at Karlstad University to become a _Civilingenjör_ in computer science. 
Or as the English name calls it: _Master of Science in Computer Engineering_. 

The intent of this site is at the moment a bit unclear. 
It might become something or it might not.
But it's fun that you found this page. 

Consider checking the <a href="/posts.html">posts</a> page to see if I've put anything there yet.
